recipe for chocolate Cakes & pastrys

      | Ingredients |

1/4 cup of plain yogurt per egg
1 tablespoon vinegar+ 1 teaspoon baking powder whisked together per egg
1/4 cup mashed banana per egg
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce per egg

       I used Hershey’s Unsweetened Cocoa Powder in order 
       to use a brand that is most widely available to my readers. 
       I’m also fond of using higher quality cocoa powders like Ghiradelli’s or cocoa powders
        from specialty chocolatier shops, but those are pretty pricey.
         I don’t recommend using cheap store brands.
       and cook in oven
